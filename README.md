# Arbitrary Neural Artistic StylizationÂ¶
There are a lot of ways that we can look at art and images with neural networks, but can we use those networks to make art for us? Yes. Yes we can, and it's not too difficult.

The contents of this notebook allow for the user to upload two images (or use the ones here from Unsplash). The model will learn the style of the style image and try to recreate the content image using those stylistic attributes. The result is pure art. The model used here was developed by Magenta and a writeup on the general structure of the model can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06830
